Mouse because rat, but cuter.
Trap because `my_tribe[i].gender_expression`[^0].
Mousetrap because [bias blindness][^1], a [low-information heuristic][^2] about how learning about biases possibly makes you more blind to the ones you have yourself.

Mousetrap has to do with modesty. I strive to adhere to the [good kind][^3] but I'm not sure I successfully do.
This is relevant because evidentially my communication might come across as overconfident at some point.
This is for the sake of clarity, but it might not be and I might have no good reason for my overconfident communication, feel free to sanction responsibly[^4].

Another communication style I hold is that I don't regularly state that everything I say is "merely from my point of view".
This is because never have I said anything that is not from my point of view.
When I talk about you, I talk about how I envision you.
When I talk about your point of view, I talk about how I think about your point of view.
I regularly encounter humans who request me to stay verbose about that.
(I think) They are vulnerable for deceit, so I have patience for repeating this obviosity upon request[^5].

More things that are useful to know when reading my writings: I strive to be [meta-honest][^6], but that's hard.
I want to publish a formal list of conditions under which I honestly pledge to be honest, but I haven't made that list of conditions yet.[^7]
For the record: A speaker lies when they _increase the Distance between their world model with that of the Listener_.
Honesty is about decreasing that Distance.
Untill we find a formal measure of Distance I'll define it here as "whatever notion of distance-between-world-models the speaker deems Relevant".
The word Relevant might now be abused, I can't formalize this further aside from mentioning that I suspuct that distance-between-world-models is a useful concept in many different cases and that its usefulness likely decreases if its implementation varies depending on context.
I suspect that anyone who regularly shifts their implementation of distance-between-world-models does this (out of ~~stupidity~~ suboptimality or) for the sake of being able to Goodheart my definition of lying.
Listener here is again what the speaker thinks is their listener.
So if a marketer of snake oil, who talks to a desparate crowd of cancer patients says "this product has a greater than 0 chance of curing cancer", they are lying despite saying nothing false.
Why are they lying?
Because they have foreseen that the chance now has increased that the listener thinks that the advertised snake oil is worth buying to cure them of their cancer while the marketer would not try this product if they had cancer.

I try not to ascribe disagreement to malice when it can be explained with (my own) studitiy[^8].
In line with this, I try not to discredit an argument based on the person stating it.
In practice I do, because status is a nearly irresistable heuristic, but this family of cases is a misapplication of the heuristic.
`facts_that_make_you_more_likely_to_interpret_me_in_the_way_i_intend_to_be_interpreted += 1`

I postponed for long with publicizing myself because of the possibility of angry internet mobs.
I can demonstrate my altruism for the sake of avoiding those, but I don't like doing that for the sake of avoidance.
_But_ I probably will when I feel unsafe.

I write with the intention for you to not _need_ to read the footings.

[^0]: I'm aware of controversy, I think controversy is somewhat gender so it fits. I subscribe to the platinum rule as far as it doesn't infringe on me. I don't know (yet?) where the boundaries between you and me lie, but I (trust that you agree with me that I) own the wording of my self-expression.

[^3]: Cannot easily find the link, but I'm talking about the difference between epistemic modesty and mere signalling. Also awe in how my sentence is perfectly ambiguous about which of the two modesties it embodies.
[^4]: Responsibly is a scary word because it opens you up for me berating you for doing something wrong. Not that I will, but you-who-doesnt-know-me might think I would. I-who-has-a-hunch-about-my-emotional-reactions knows I won't berate uselessly without apologizing for it but you aren't sure of that even after reading this. I want to make a promise now that I'll clear this up later, but this is my first post so who knows what I'll do with Mousetrap. I hope for our sakes that I adress this better when better adressing is needed.
[^5]: I will use words that aren't in a dictionary. This one happened to be in a dictionary. I could have written it differently but my vocabulary is slim and I hope to improve it by not only using words I know are in the dictionary.

[^7]: And it might be a horrible idea to (mention that I might) publish such a list.
