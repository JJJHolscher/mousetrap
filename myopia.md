epistemic status: thoughts during a walk

# MYOPIA

I like chocolate bars, but I don't like that I like them.
I like them because they're tasty.
I don't like them because they're unhealthy.
If you ask me whether I want one later I'll tend to decline.
But if you give me one and stare at me I'll eat and savour it.

This is myopia, I care about things in my (temporal) vicinity.
Myopia is often viewed as irrational.
The fact that our ancestors polluted the earth for example was partly due to myopia.
Among other circumstances, people just did not care that much about the far future.
Myopia is seen as an obstactle in our path to achieving our values.

## myopia as the shape of our values

I will now entertain the thought that myopia cannot be disentangled from our values.
My argument is evolution.
Our values are proxies for evolutionary fitness.
Lust is a proxy for replication, hunger for survival etc.
All our values are myopic since for a long time, the future brings more uncertainty which makes any plan that needs a longer effort more likely to fail.
This is still ingrained in every human.
An example is how even the brightest minds did not start working on AIS untill its failure modes seemed possible to occur during their lifetimes, despite the possibly astronomical risks which could have been reduced by earlier research.

## myopia instead of cumulative reward

If we want to maximize our values over time (cumulative reward), then we should reduce our myopic urges.
But given that our values are of myopic shapes, it might be nonsensical to view our values through the lens of cumulative reward.
If we optimize some artificial superintelligence (ASI) to satisfy our values, we might want it to know that humans are myopic and that it should discount any future values it hands us accordingly.

A positive is that we humans will still get honest involuntary hardships, possibly including death.
A negative is that we humans will still get honest involuntary hardships, possibly including death.

With some parameter tuning, we will keep existing for most of the duration of the universe.
But we will likely expend all resources earlier than in the cumulative case.
